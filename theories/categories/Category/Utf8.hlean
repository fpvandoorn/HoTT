Infix "∘" := compose (at level 40, left associativity) : morphism_scope.
Notation "m ⁻¹" := (morphism_inverse m) (at level 3, format "m '⁻¹'") : morphism_scope.
Infix "≅" := Isomorphic (at level 70, no associativity) : category_scope.
Notation "x ↠ y" := (Epimorphism x y)
                      (at level 99, right associativity, y at level 200).
Notation "x ↪ y" := (Monomorphism x y)
                      (at level 99, right associativity, y at level 200).

/- It would be nice to put [, format "C 'ᵒᵖ'"] here, but that makes
    this notation unparseable. -/
Notation "C 'ᵒᵖ'" := (opposite C) (at level 3) : category_scope.

Notation "∀  x .. y , P" := (Πx, .. (Πy, P) ..)
                              (at level 200, x binder, y binder, right associativity).
Notation "∀  x .. y , P" := (Πx, .. (Πy, P) ..)
                              (at level 200, x binder, y binder, right associativity) : type_scope.
Notation "∀  x .. y , P" := (pi (λx, .. (pi (λy, P)) .. ))
                              (at level 200, x binder, y binder, right associativity) : category_scope.
